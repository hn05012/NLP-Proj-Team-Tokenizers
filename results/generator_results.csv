google/flan-t5-small, Why does inspect fail to get source file for classes in a dynamically-imported module?                                    , "The logic for getting the source file for a class looks like this: if isclass(object): if hasattr(object, '__module__'): module = sys.modules.get(object.__module__) if getattr(module, '__file__', None): return module.__file__ if object.__module__ == '__main__': raise OSError('source code not available') raise TypeError('{!r} is a built-in class'.format(object)) In your case module.Bar.__module__ is 'thing2', which has not been added to sys.modules. Hence this machinery concludes (incorrectly) that it must be built-in, and raises an error claiming as much. Am I missing something during my import step that tells Python how to get source info for classes? Yes; note that the recipe in the importlib docs includes an explicit step to update sys.modules, as exec_module doesn't do it: import importlib.util import sys def import_from_path(module_name, file_path): spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, file_path) module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec) sys.modules[module_name] = module spec.loader.exec_module(module) return module Similarly adding sys.modules[&quot;thing2&quot;] = module into thing1.py would allow it to show the class implementation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , I cannot confidently answer based on the provided context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,      0.839, False      , 0.01990049751243781 , 0.825993537902832 ,     184.67,                0,     677.6

For example: import json # ... ... ... obj = { &quot;notes&quot;: [{ &quot;id&quot;: i + 1, &quot;vector&quot;: embeddings[0], &quot;payload&quot;: { &quot;node&quot;: texts[0] } }] } print(&quot;PUT collection/ObsiidanNotes/notes&quot;) print(json.dumps(obj, indent=4)) This way you avoid errors in that JSON syntax, like for instance misbalancing brackets. Using two print calls (one for static text, another for JSON) seems fine to me. But if you really need it with one print, then: print(f&quot;PUT collection/ObsiidanNotes/notes\n{json.dumps(obj, indent=4)}&quot;)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , I cannot confidently answer based on the provided context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,      0.774, False      , 0.016260162601626018, 0.8287050724029541,     195.27,                0,     708.8

This is equivalent to the &quot;any&quot; function: def any(iterable): for element in iterable: if element: return True return False So it iterates.

These built-in functions are generic, special cases like this (if the collection becomes big enough) might be handled better by your own implementation.

google/flan-t5-small, Fastest way to bulk-write lossless WebP from a NumPy RGBA array in Python?                                                , "Here are a few things that helped me improve speed in a similar setup: 1. Use webp.WebPConfig + WebPPicture Instead of imwrite(), try going lower-level. You can set method=0, thread_level=1, and fine-tune compression settings manually. This gives better control and usually better performance. 2. Encode to memory first Use webp.encode() to get the encoded bytes in memory, then write to disk separately. You can also write to a RAM disk to avoid I/O bottlenecks. 3. Split encoding and writing Even with multiprocessing, ensure encoding and writing are handled in separate steps or pools. Encoding, then queuing, and then writing is much more efficient than doing both in a single worker."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , I cannot confidently answer based on the provided context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,      0.764, False      , 0.015873015873015876, 0.8305342197418213,     204.53,                0,     687.8

You first have to define the nodes (which in my case was the list of distinct materials) and the edges (everything else), then create the graph, iterate through the levels of the graph, and union all the results together. Here's the code: from pyspark.sql import functions as F, types as T, SparkSession from graphframes import GraphFrame spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() df = spark.createDataFrame( [ (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A1&quot;, 1300, 1.0), (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, 1300, 0.056), (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A3&quot;, 1300, 2.78), (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, 1300, 1300.5), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;B1&quot;, 1000, 1007.0), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, 1000, 3.5), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, 1000, 9.0), (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, 800, 806.4), ], [&quot;Material&quot;, &quot;Component&quot;, &quot;BatchSize&quot;, &quot;RequiredQuantity&quot;], ) nodes = ( df.select(F.col(&quot;Material&quot;).alias(&quot;id&quot;)) .union(df.select(F.col(&quot;Component&quot;).alias(&quot;id&quot;))) .distinct() ) edges = ( df.select( F.col(&quot;Material&quot;).alias(&quot;src&quot;), F.col(&quot;Component&quot;).alias(&quot;dst&quot;), &quot;BatchSize&quot;, &quot;RequiredQuantity&quot; ) .union( df.select( &quot;Component&quot;, F.lit(None), F.lit(None), F.lit(None), F.lit(None), ) ) .distinct() ) graph = GraphFrame(nodes, edges) @F.udf(T.DoubleType()) def calculate_quantity(*edges: list[dict]) -&gt; float: result = edges[0][&quot;RequiredQuantity&quot;] for e in edges[1:]: result *= e[&quot;RequiredQuantity&quot;] / e[&quot;BatchSize&quot;] return result results = spark.createDataFrame([], df.schema) i = 1 while True: query = &quot;;&quot;.join(f&quot;(v{j})-[e{j}]-&gt;(v{j+1})&quot; for j in range(i)) tmp = graph.find(query) if tmp.isEmpty(): break results = results.union( tmp.select( F.col(&quot;v0&quot;)[&quot;id&quot;], F.col(f&quot;v{i}&quot;)[&quot;id&quot;], F.col(&quot;e0&quot;)[&quot;BatchSize&quot;], calculate_quantity(*(col for col in tmp.columns if col.startswith(&quot;e&quot;))), ) ) i += 1 This only took a little over 7 minutes to run for all ~5000 materials.

Maybe you do not want that. The second issue is that your data has logarithmic character, and it is difficult for the algorithms to cope with the change in magnitudes in particular on the time values. I used scipy.interpolate.make_smoothing_spline to fit your data. To see it better, I changed the plot to a log-x scale. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.interpolate import make_smoothing_spline time = [0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000] intensity = [2722.164194, 2877.627742, 2663.520645, 2708.928125, 2545.461613, 2421.236129, 1885.837742, 1710.483871, 1275.428387, 776.0895806, 192.4806452, 26.35279] fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.semilogx(time, intensity, &quot;.&quot;) x2 = np.logspace(start=-1, stop=4, num=100) for lam in (0, 1, 10, 100): smooth_func = make_smoothing_spline(np.log(time), intensity, lam=lam) y2 = smooth_func(np.log(x2)) ax.semilogx(x2, y2, label=rf&quot;$\lambda = {lam}$&quot;) ax.set_ylim([0, None]) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Trapping time (ms)&quot;) ax.legend(loc=&quot;best&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;Average Intensity (counts/s)&quot;) plt.show() As you see, you can now chose the trade-off between matching every point and obtaining a smooth line via the lam parameter.
